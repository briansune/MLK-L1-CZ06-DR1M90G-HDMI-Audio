Pure Verilog-Based HDMI Audio

Due to the Anlogic TD compiler is so bad on handling systemverilog.

This repository intended to make a workable HDMI audio output.

Remember to use a long FM antenna to receive the radio channel.

The background noise might be large due to the atan and the CIC of the Anlogic IP is not that great.
